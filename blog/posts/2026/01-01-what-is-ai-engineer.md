title: 'No really, what is an AI Engineer nowadays?'
excerpt: "Spoiler: It's way more complicated than it should be"

I got started in the tech industry in September of 2017. I signed up for an internship via email and had 1 round of interview with "3 months of Java" being most of my skillset. For some reason, that landed me a position as an (unpaid) intern in an AI research team and kickstarted my career as an AI Engineer.

I think my experience pretty much summed up the general vibe of AI during that pre-2022 period. The industry was warming up to the notion that maybe machine learning was useful, ConvNets and LSTMs were crushing benchmarks left and right, and every company wanted to throw something at AI to see if it stuck. Granted, during the 3 years I spent at that first company, my title was also some variation of "Software Developer".
